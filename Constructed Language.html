<h2>Sounds</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Population</h3>
<p>This starts with the population speaking the language. 
Simple languages by single groups like nomads, city-states etc.
are going to have fewer sounds in their languages.</p>
<p>The smallest number of vowels in existing languages is 3, of consonants, 6. <br>
The largest number of vowels is 7, of consonants, 25.</p>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('3-4 Vowels, 7-11 Consonants')" value="Single Population"><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('4-5 Vowels, 11-16 Consonants')" value="City State"><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('5-6 Vowels, 16-21 Consonants')" value="Major Melting Pot"><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('5-6 Vowels, 21-25 Consonants')" value="Multi Country"><br>

<li><h3>Limitation</h3>
<p>So you're wearing fangs or fake tusks for a costume. Notice anything?</p>
<p>How about listening to creatures whose tongues are thin?</p>
<p>Suffice to say, some sounds just aren't going to happen.</p><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('No Bilabial Sounds, nothing that requires lips.')"value="Fangs, Tusks, or Lacking Lips"><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('No Nasals or Plosives, nothing that involves totally closing off airflow.')"value="Thin Tongues and Hissy Fits"><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('No Nasals. Embrace the sound of the common cold.')"value="No Noses"><br></li>
</ul>

<section id="two">
<div class="container">
<h3>Rules and Roots</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>First rule: KPTHFFBT often offends. </p>
<p>Decide how many consonants are allowed to stand next to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second Rule: If a language is Lingua Franca, a "Bridge Language" or "Trade Language,
 it works best for the sounds of the bigger language to be taken from the "Bridged" language.</p>
<p>Bonus points if the loaned sounds are attached to concepts relevant to the "Bridged" culture</p>
<p>That is, if there is a mining culture, the sounds for "ore" "pick" etc. probably came from that culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final Sound Rule: Don't use sounds you can't make, or sounds you can't recognize. 
<br>Please. Do. Not.</p><br>
<p>You will be asked to say it for your readers.</p>
<p>If you really want to know <a href = "https://www.ipachart.com/" target="_blank">how it sounds</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Affixes And Wierd Word Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>In-word Rule 1: Words can be changed by Affixes.</p>
<table style="width:80%">
<tr><th>Prefix</th><td>Add to beginning</td><td>Un-, Anti-, Dis-, Etc.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Infix</th><td>Add inside the word</td><td>Not in English except for profanity. Unbe-f******-lievable.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Suffix</th><td>Add to end</td><td>-tion, -ity, -er, -ness, -ism, Etc.</td></tr>
</table></li>
<li><p>In-word Rule 2: Transitivity.</p>
<p>Does the Verb require a Direct object. Ex; "I Run" is fine but "He Instilled" is missing something.</p>
</p>
<li><p>In-word Rule 3: Causatives.</p>
<p>Are there second person verbs? For example: "I <strong>made</strong> him do it."</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-word Rule 4: Tenses</p>
<p>Past, Present, and Future are simple but not the simplest.
English requires extra words like "will do" to make future tense happen.</p>
<p>Some languages need extra words for every tense, some languages have more than three tenses.</p></li>
<li><p>In-word Rule 5:Manner</p>
<p>This is where tense asks whether an action has been completed yet. 
Your present and past Perfects, for example.</p>
<p>Is there a way to tell if an action is complete?</p></li>
<li><p>Plurals</p>
<p>Plural Marker: -s or many, or lots of etc.</p>
<p>Magic Number Specification When does counting turn into plural word? One, Two, Many, Too Many?</p>
<p>No Plurals: number + noun, If the group is uncountably big, there will be a number that means uncountable like 40 or 77.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Grammar Rules</h3>
<p>Word Order</p>
<ul>
<li>No Order: Subjects, Verbs, and Objects etc are declared by Affixes.</li>
<li>Subject-Verb-Object</li>
<li>Subject-Object-Verb</li>
<li>Verb-Subject-Object</li>
<li>Verb-Object-Subject</li>
<li>Object-Verb-Subject</li>
<li>Object-Subject-Verb</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Research and write major myths without any names, maybe choose real myths with the names removed.</p>
<p>Examples: King X pulled the X weapon from X stone. God(dess) X had X, Y, and Z children. 
Y wrote M language. Emperor/ess turned into the C mountain when they died. Etc.</p>
<p>Generate names to replace the letters</p>
<p><a href = "https://www.random.org/lists/" target="_blank">List Randomizer website</a> 
The original name but pronounced with mouth full, Etc.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> X weapon is now Dolgrath, Mother Goddess is now Shinit.</p>
<br>
<p>Use those as base words whose definition is the general noun of the object</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> Gratha was a mace so now “gratha” means “mace.” 
Shinit means “Mother Goddess” now and is applied to other maternal 
goddesses as a title.</p>
<br>
<p>Deconstruct the longer ones to mean full sentences.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> “Shi” means mother now and “nit” means “All.” 
Possibly “Nit” can mean “Queen” if the culture claims their rulers are 
descended from that goddess, like Pharohs.</p>
<br>
<p>Count out the sounds in those chosen words</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> Consonants: [ʃ], [n], [t], [g], [r], [θ] Vowels: [i], [I], [ɐ], [ʌ]</p>
<br>
<p>Repeat but less freely</p>
<p>Step 1 myths must have relationships to previous choices.</p>
<p>There cannot be two gods/goddesses of the same thing without fighting.</p>
<p>Myths about the same god with different morals or opposing characteristics attached to the same character require explanation</p>
<br>
<p>Step 2 Minimize permitted sounds during name generation.</p>
<p>Replace letters or ban words with too many outside parameters.</p> 
<br>
<p>Step 3 specify definitions properly</p>
<p>If two goddesses have “Mother” aspects maybe one has 
implications of birth-giver (Gaia) and the other has 
found-mother aspects or was a drift from “Aunt” etc.</p>
<p>Mercury is not Odin and polarizing their specific meanings 
and definitions allows for more range.</p>
<br>
<p>Step 4 Pay attention to repeated syllables.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> If Shinit and Dalshi are both associated with rulership
 then “Shi” also has “ruler” connotations. 
if Dalshi is male then Masculine titles follow names while feminine titles 
precede them and this tells something about word order. <br>
<i>As above,</i> if “Shi” means “mother” it might change to mean parent 
or there may be specific connotations about the job of a king/queen</p><br>
&nbsp;
<p>Once you have enough words to rewrite the single-sentence myth, then you 
have enough to scatter into the rest of the story.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b> If a local ruler is mentioned then they are called by "shi."
You might call a parent or parent-figure "shi" as well. If Dai meant "trickster"
 then an old man may yell "Dai Dai!" at the brat that tp'd his house.</p><br>
<p>While it would be impressive to create a functional language and write an 
entire book in it, nobody would read that. The best way then, is to find 
common phrases, deep cultural references, things that people would pepper their 
language with, exclamations, profanity, greetings, parts of speech, phrases and 
lessons.</p><br>
<p><i>"Excalibur"</i> comes from the Welsh word for sword.</p>
