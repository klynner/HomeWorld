										<h2>About Worldbuilding</h2>
										<h3>Setting</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Setting is difficult. To the one side of the tightrope, plotholes and whining reviewers. 
									To the other side, an endless drop into Worldbuilder's disease</p>
									<p>First bit of advice? Study history, real history, and you will be significantly less 
									likely to make mistakes.</p>
									<p>Second bit? Look up other people's mistakes, and get sensitivity readers 
									for <strong>every</strong> step of a process. The earlier the better. Don't be the person 
									who had to rewrite major plot points because they didn't know minorities 								
									existed everywhere before the 1960s. Don't be the person with the entire market 
									laughing at them because of simple mistakes.</p>
									<p>Third bit? You're going to make mistakes. People are going to be mean 
									about your baby. All you can do is make them work for it.</p>
									<p>Here's where you can start</p>

									<h3>Constructed Language</h3>
									<p>Granddaddy Tolkien is famous for great books, brick books,
									codifying Epic Fantasy, and being patient-0 for worldbuilder's disease.</p>
									<p>Languages are hard. Worse, most instructions involve extended hours 
									of work to produce entire lexicons, most of which will go unused.</p>
									<p>Setting can have a generator; there are only so many necessary details, 
									and those details will hint at deeper worldbuilding you don't actually have to do. 
									Languages are not going to do so well. Like the people speaking, they are more 
									organic. The process on the Conlang page of this site will show you how to create 
									a few sentences, god and goddess names, and all with sounds that imply a single 
									language with deeper meaning.</p><br>
									<p>Tolkien would be proud</p>

									<h3>About Pantheons of Gods and Goddesses</h3>
									<p>The language is the hardest part and the leftovers of that process 
									produces names for gods and goddesses. Further advice is on the page 
									in question.</p>
									<h4>Quick rule-run:</h4>
									<ol>
									<li>Sky gods are not neccessarily king gods. Pre-Greek-Dark-Ages 
									the king of the Greek gods was Poseidon. </li>
									<li>Gods of Creation Myths take the PATH method of Purpose, Authority, Treachery, and Harbor 
									gods and goddesses. Not necessarily in that order.</li>
									<li>There will be at least one myth that is different every time you hear it. 
									Maybe the trickster was blinded by pitch, maybe he juggled his eyeballs, maybe it was 
									a badger friend, maybe it was a skunk.</li>
									<li>Not every character worships every god(ess). If the character isn't a blacksmith 
									then the god of smiths and forges is generally irrelevant to them. Creators, Love god(esse)s, and ruler god(esse)s.</li>
									<li>Religion is (usually) a major part of people's lives. Don't lay out the gods 
									then claim there's no place to worship them. Temples are a thing that happen.
									Priests tend to be respected. Relevant god(esse)s should be treated as such.</li>
									</ol>
