<p>The world is complicated.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Fictional worlds are no less complicated, we merely see less of them. However, unless you are the next coming of 
J. R. R. Tolkien, falling down the hobbit hole to discover the full personal history of every tree, rock, and random woodsman, you 
probably would prefer a simpler task.
</p> 
<p>Languages are only simpler by comparison, and contain several steps. Most of those steps are for linguists and
are generally irrelevant to the average writer. The book is not going to be written in that language after all, nobody would read it.
Significantly easier is the surface level worldbuilding provided by this site.</p>
<p>This site provides, on surface level, the illusion of depth. 
The thing about illusions though, is that once you can see it, you can describe it. You can write it.</p>
<p>This site is not for character creation, unless the characters you seek are very simply godly archetypes.</p>
<p>This site is not for complete language creation, which will take a great deal of work on your end.</p>
<p>This site cannot and will not assist with plot, detailing, or other specifics, except in those illusions of depth.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you will have to make choices. These are up to you, and very important. You can make any choice you like.
You can choose any ridiculous rule that suits your work. </p>

<p>Welcome Weary Traveler. Today we shall attend the portals to the worlds in your heart.</p>
